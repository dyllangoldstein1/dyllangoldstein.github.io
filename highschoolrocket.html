                        <!-- Placeholder: Describe the project. Mention it was a high school activity, and you designed, built, and launched model rockets. -->
                        This project was my first hands-on introduction to engineering principles, undertaken during high school. It involved the complete process of designing, constructing, and successfully launching several model rockets, which solidified my interest in pursuing a career in engineering.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Design & Learning Process</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        <!-- Placeholder: Explain what you learned. Talk about calculating the center of pressure and center of gravity to ensure stability. Mention fin design, material selection, and the assembly process. -->
                        The core of the project was understanding the physics of flight stability. I learned how to calculate the Center of Pressure (CP) and Center of Gravity (CG) for my designs, ensuring the CG was forward of the CP for a stable trajectory. This involved careful selection of materials and precise construction of the body, nose cone, and fins.

                        <!-- Placeholder: Summarize the results. Mention successful launches and recoveries. Emphasize that this project was what sparked your passion for engineering and gave you a practical application of physics. -->
                        Through numerous successful launches and recoveries, this project transformed my theoretical knowledge of physics into a tangible and exciting application. It was a foundational experience that taught me the importance of careful design, iterative testing, and the satisfaction of seeing an engineering project come to life.
