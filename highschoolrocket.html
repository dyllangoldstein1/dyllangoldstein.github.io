                        <!-- Placeholder: Describe the project. Mention it was a high school activity, and you designed, built, and launched model rockets. -->
                        This project was my first hands-on engineering experience. Competing in The American Rocketry Challenge, I captained my high school team in building several competition rockets with the goal altitude and flight time changing every year.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Design & Learning Process</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        <!-- Placeholder: Explain what you learned. Talk about calculating the center of pressure and center of gravity to ensure stability. Mention fin design, material selection, and the assembly process. -->
                        Working on these rockets taught me the core principles of design as I worked in OpenRocket to simulate varying rocket designs. Eventually once a material, height, engine, and fin count was settled on, I got to create and mentor others on the assembly of a model rocket.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Outcome & What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>
                        <!-- Placeholder: Summarize the results. Mention successful launches and recoveries. Emphasize that this project was what sparked your passion for engineering and gave you a practical application of physics. -->
                        Through numerous successful launches and recoveries, this project transformed my knowledge of physics into something both tangible and exciting. It was the experinece that led me to want to pursue engineering and continue working on projects throught my education and career.
