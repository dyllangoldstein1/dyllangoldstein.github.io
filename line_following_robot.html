                    <p class="mb-4">
                        This project had the goal of programming a vehicle that could autonomously navigate a random path with pre-defined challenges. The robot used IR sensors located on its underside to detect a black-line and decision making algorithms programmed in to address challenges such as split or lost paths.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having to ensure the robot reacted to obstacles with varying demands posed a great challenge with some requiring sharp turns while others required avoiding an overcorrection. This was overcome with a weighting scheme and path recovery algorithm. The weighting scheme ensured that when encountering two potential
                        paths, the robot would prioritize the path to its left side. This implementation was reveresed when returning.

                        Additionally, a path recovery algorithm was crucial to accomplishing "jumps" where the line stopped and moved to the side. This way when the robot would lose sight of the track with would slowly drift until it once again found the line. From there PID controls took over and ensured the robot stayed on course.

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Core Concepts & Implementation</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The robot's functionality is based on three key subsystems:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2 space-y-2">
                            <li><strong>Sensor Array:</strong> An array of infrared (IR) sensors used to detect the line. The white surface reflects IR light, while the black line absorbs it. Using analog values from the phototransistors, robot could determine its position relative to the line.</li>
                            <li><strong>Motor Control:</strong> A motor driver allows the microcontroller to precisely control the speed and direction of the two DC motors connected to the wheels. By varying the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal sent to each motor, the robot was able to accomplish sharp turns, gradual curves, or move straight.</li>
                            <li><strong>Control Logic:</strong> The core of the project was the implementation of conditional logic, weighting schemes, and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controls to create a smooth and fast navigation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Anticipated Outcome & Skills Gained</h2>
                    <p>
                        The final outcome was a fully autonomous robot capable of navigating a complex track with curves and intersections. The project provided hands-on experience in microcontroller programming and control system theory.
