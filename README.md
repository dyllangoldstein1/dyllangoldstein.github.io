EE Portfolio Website Template
This is a clean and professional portfolio website template for Electrical Engineering students. It's built with HTML and Tailwind CSS and is designed to be hosted for free on GitHub Pages.

How to Use This Template
Add Files to Your Repository: Place the index.html and README.md files into the local folder for your your-username.github.io repository on your computer.

Customize the Content: Open the index.html file in a text editor and replace the placeholder content with your own information:

Update your name, bio, and contact information.

Add your projects with descriptions, images, and links to their GitHub repositories.

List your specific technical skills.

Upload your resume as a PDF to the repository and update the link in the "Resume" section.

Push to GitHub & Go Live: Use the command line to "commit" and "push" these new files to your GitHub repository. Once pushed, your website will be live at https://your-username.github.io within a few minutes.

Customization Tips
Project Images: Replace the https://placehold.co/... links with images of your own projects. You can add image files to your repository and link to them directly (e.g., <img src="project1.jpg" ...>).

Styling: The template uses Tailwind CSS, which means you can change the design by editing the class names directly in the HTML. No separate CSS file is needed.

Resume: After adding your resume PDF to the folder (e.g., My_Resume.pdf), change the href="#" in the resume button to href="My_Resume.pdf".

Good luck!
