                    <p class="mb-4">
                        This project focused on developing a trust algorithm-powered travel agent that could do the heavy lifting to develop the perfect itenerary. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was a challenging project that put my programming skills to the test as my program had to not only piece understand flight schedules,
                        but piece together an efficient route avoiding long layovers and missed connections.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Challenges & Solutions</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The first main challenge was managing the massive flight dataset efficiently.
                        Using a naive search for connecting flights would be far too slow. To solve this, I designed the FlightManager
                        class to pre-process the data, then storing it in a hash map where each airport code mapped to a Binary 
                        Search Tree I developed containting its outbound flights, sorted by departure time. The result was incredibly fast lookups with an
                        average Big O of O(log F), where F is the number of flights from an airport. This was key to improving the performance of the pathfinding algorithm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another significant hurdle I tackeled was the issue that a simple search algorithm like Breadth-First Search was insufficient for the task at hand, as it finds the route with the fewest flights,
                        not the shortest total travel time. I'd argue that, a two-flight trip with a 10-hour layover is going to be a much bigger headache than a three-flight trip with two 1-hour layovers. To find the truly optimal route,
                        I opted to use an A* search algorithm. I used a priority queue to explore various itineraries with priority based on the actual time already traveled, plus the time needed to get to the destination.
                        This implementation allowed for the search to analyze the most promising routes first.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Outcome & What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>
                        The final algorithm successfully generated optimal flight itineraries from a database of thousands of real-world flights, dealing with constraints like minimum connection times and maximum layovers. Through this project, 
                        I gained practical experience in designing and implementing complex algorithms like A*. I also honed my skills in C++ data structures by building a Binary Search Tree from scratch and applying my knowledge to solve a tangible,
                         real-world logistics problem.
